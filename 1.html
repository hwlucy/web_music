<p>Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you
fixed them
Now you've been talking
in your sleep oh oh
Things you never say to me oh oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second
we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars
on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
Oh we had everything
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
Yeah but this is happenin'
You've been havin'
real bad dreams oh oh
You used to lie
so close to me oh oh
There's nothing more than
empty sheets
Between our love our love
Oh our love our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second
we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars
on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Oh tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad
as it seems
We'll come clean
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars
on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars
on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Oh we can learn to love again
Oh we can learn to love again
Oh that we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again</p>
