<p>There's no reason, there's no rhyme
 I found myself blindsided by
 A feeling that I've never known
 I'm dealing with it on my own
 Phone is quiet, walls are bare
 I drink myself to sleep, who cares
 No one even has to know
 I'm dealing with it on my own

 I've got way too much time to be this hurt
 Somebody help, it's getting worse
 What do you do with a broken heart?
 Once the light fades everything is dark
 Way too much whiskey in my blood
 I feel my body giving up
 Can I hold on for another night?
 What do I do with all this time?

 Every thought when it gets late
 Puts me in a fragile state
 I wish I wasn't going home
 Dealing with it on my own
 I'm praying but it's not enough
 I'm done, I don't believe in love
 Learning how to let it go
 Dealing with it on my own

 I've got way too much time to be this hurt
 Somebody help, it's getting worse
 What do you do with a broken heart?
 Once the light fades everything is dark
 Way too much whiskey in my blood
 I feel my body giving up
 Can I hold on for another night?
 What do I do with all this time, yeah?

 I drive circles under street lights
 Nothing seems to clear my mind
 I can't forget, get this out my head so
 I drive chasing Malibu nights
 Nothing seems to heal my mind
 I can't forget

 I've got way too much time to be this hurt
 Somebody help it's getting worse
 What do you do with a broken heart?
 Once the light fades everything is dark
 Way too much whiskey in my blood
 I feel my body giving up
 Can I hold on for another night?
 What do I do with all this time, yeah?

 I drive circles under street lights
 Nothing seems to clear my mind
 I can't forget, get this out my head so
 I drive chasing Malibu nights
 Nothing seems to heal my mind
 I can't forget, get this out my head so
 I drive chasing Malibu nights
 Nothing seems to heal my mind...
